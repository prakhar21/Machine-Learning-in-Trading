This repo is my understanding and learnings from Machine Learning for Trading Specialization on Coursera

## My Background
I am currently in my 2nd year of MS (by research) program in Data Science, with CS as majors in undergrad. I have a industry experience of 3 years in Data Science and particularly NLP domain. Recently, I have started to explore the usecases and ML algorithms in finance domain. Just to let you know, I am very new to finance domain and it's terminologies. Before starting this course (ML in Trading) i have completed [Investment Management using Python and Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/investment-management-python-machine-learning) course from coursera couple of days ago. So, this is my current knowledge of finance and my background, hope this will help you choose better in terms of how to follow this repository.
